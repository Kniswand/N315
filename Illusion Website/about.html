    <h1>About Illusions</h1>
    <h3>An illusion is a distortion of the senses, which can reveal
    how the mind normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. 
    Although illusions distort the human perception of reality, they are 
    generally shared by most people. This page will detail all
    about these illusions.</h3>
    <p>Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual 
        illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. 
        The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often 
        dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a 
        ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy 
        since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.</p>

        <p>Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes 
            during perception. These assumptions are made using 
            organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an 
            individual's capacity for depth perception and motion 
            perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur 
            because of biological sensory structures within the human body 
            or conditions outside the body within one's physical environment.</p>
        
        <p>The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory 
            distortion. Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in 
            the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a 
            misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing 
            voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, 
            whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water 
            (or another auditory source) would be an illusion.</p>

            <h1>Different Kinds of Illusions</h1>
            <h3>Optical Illusions</h3>
            <p>A visual illusion or optical illusion is characterized by visually perceived images that are deceptive or misleading. Therefore, the information gathered by the visual sense is processed to give, on the face of it, a percept that does not tally with information from other senses or physical measurements. </p>
            <h3>Auditory Illusions</h3>
            <p>An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing, the auditory equivalent of a visual illusion: the listener hears either sound which are not present in the stimulus, or "impossible" sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse). One example of an auditory illusion is a Shepard tone. </p>
            <h3>Tactile Illusions</h3>
            <p>Examples of tactile illusions include phantom limb, the thermal grill illusion, the cutaneous rabbit illusion and a curious illusion that occurs when the crossed index and middle fingers are run along the bridge of the nose with one finger on each side, resulting in the perception of two separate noses. The brain areas activated during illusory tactile perception are similar to those activated during actual tactile stimulation. Tactile illusions can also be elicited through haptic technology. These "illusory" tactile objects can be used to create "virtual objects".</p>
            <h3>Temporal Illusions</h3>
            <p>A temporal illusion is a distortion in the perception of time, which occurs when the time interval between two or more events is very narrow (typically less than a second). In such cases, a person may momentarily perceive time as slowing down, stopping, speeding up, or running backward. </p>
