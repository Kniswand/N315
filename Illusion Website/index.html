    <h1>Optical Illusions</h1>
    <h3>In visual perception, an optical illusion, also called an visual illusion, is an illusion caused by the 
    visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably
    appears to differ from reality. An example of this is the images below, 
    in which the gray squares labbeled "A" and "B" appear to be
    shaded differently, when they are actually the same color.</h3>

    <h1>Other Illusions</h1>
    <h3>Illusions come in many forms including: visual, auditory, tactile, and
    temporal. For example, a temporal illusion could be an inaccurate estimations
    of time which could be due to external variables such as jet lag or a lack        of stimulation. Below is an image explaining how temporal illusions work.
